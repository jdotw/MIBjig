MIBjig takes the text output of an snmpwalk command and parses the data to
fake those same values via either an agentx subagent, or a full SNMP agent.

For example, you can do a walk of a particular device and then have MIBjig
present those same SNMP OIDs and values via a host running Net-SNMP.

The walk must be done in Numeric Output mode (-On). Example:

snmpwalk -v 2c -On -c [community] [address] [start oid] > walk.txt

MIBjig can then be used to present those same OIDs via the local host
assuming it is using Net-SNMP and has the 'master agentx' line in its
snmpd.conf file. Exampke:

./mibjig --rocommunity=public -f walk.txt udp:6000

The --rocommunity=public specifies the authentication mechanism;
snmpd.conf entries can be specified with this mechanism; if you need
more complex authorization configuration you can use mibjig.conf, or
add "-c <config file>".

The -f argument specifies to run in foreground

The next argument is the text file containing the output of the snmpwalk
done with the -On parameter.

The final argument is the transport configuration (equivalent to
"agentaddr" in snmpd.conf).  (If you specify a port below 1024,
such as the default 161, you must run mibjig as root)

If successful, the following output should appear:

mibjig parsed configuration file walk.txt, ready to serve
listening for SNMP on udp:6000

If you would like to use AgentX to connect to an existing snmpd,
omit the "--rocommunity" configuration, use "-X" to enable AgentX, and
optionally "-x <path-to-agentx-socket>".  If mibjig is unable to connect
to the parent Net-SNMP process, ensure snmpd is running and has the
'master agentx' configuration line in the snmpd.conf file usually found
in /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
